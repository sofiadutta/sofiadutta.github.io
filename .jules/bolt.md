# Bolt's Journal - Critical Learnings

## 2025-01-08 - Large Asset Bottleneck
**Learning:** `images/about.jpg` is 2.9MB, which is extremely large for a sidebar image. This significantly impacts bandwidth availability for other critical assets (like LCP).
**Action:** Since the environment lacks image processing tools (Pillow, ImageMagick), I cannot resize it programmatically. Future optimizations should prioritize setting up an image optimization pipeline or manually resizing this asset if tools become available.

## 2025-01-08 - LCP Optimization for Background Images
**Learning:** Background images defined in CSS (or inline styles) are often discovered late by the browser. Preloading them via `<link rel="preload">` significantly aids LCP.
**Action:** Always check for critical background images in Hero sections and add preloads for them, especially when image optimization tools are unavailable to reduce their size.
## 2025-01-08 - Avoiding jQuery Instantiation in High-Frequency Listeners
**Learning:** Using jQuery selectors (e.g., `$('body')`) within high-frequency event listeners like `scroll` causes continuous object instantiation, increasing garbage collection overhead and blocking the main thread.
**Action:** When throttling listeners, also refactor the internal logic to use native DOM APIs (e.g., `document.body.classList`) to minimize memory allocation and overhead.
