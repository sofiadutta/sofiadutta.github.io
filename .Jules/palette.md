## 2024-05-23 - [Icon-Only Buttons and "Ghost" Sources]
**Learning:** Found a repository where `package.json` scripts referred to a missing `src` directory, implying the `index.html` at the root was the intended "source of truth" for this simplified version. This is a common pattern in "starter" templates where the advanced build setup is stripped out but configuration files remain.
**Action:** Always verify if build scripts actually correspond to the file structure before relying on them. When `src` is missing in a simple web project, edit the root HTML directly.

## 2024-05-23 - [Accessible Background Images and Skip Links]
**Learning:** Found critical content implemented as background images (profile photo). This pattern is invisible to screen readers unless explicitly marked with `role="img"` and `aria-label`. Also, single-page layouts like this desperately need "Skip to Content" links to allow keyboard users to bypass long navigation menus.
**Action:** When auditing legacy themes, check all `data-bg` or `background-image` inline styles for meaningful content and add ARIA attributes. Always ensure a skip link exists for sidebars.

## 2024-05-23 - [JS Crashing due to Undefined Function Call]
**Learning:** Discovered that a `ReferenceError` (calling undefined `updateYear()`) in the main JS file was silently blocking subsequent script execution, including critical features like lazy loading images. This highlights how fragile single-file script bundles can be.
**Action:** When auditing legacy JS, always check for console errors first. If a function call blocks execution, verify if it's defined. If not, and a correct alternative exists (`updateCopyrightYear`), remove the blocker.

## 2024-05-23 - [Tooltips for Icon-Only Buttons]
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons (like social links) are ambiguous for mouse users. While `aria-label` helps screen readers, sighted users benefit significantly from a native browser tooltip via the `title` attribute.
**Action:** Always add `title` attributes matching the `aria-label` for icon-only interactive elements.

## 2024-05-23 - [De-obfuscating Anti-Spam Emails for Clipboard]
**Learning:** When dealing with anti-spam obfuscated email text, storing the real email in a data attribute defeats the purpose of the obfuscation. Furthermore, when replacing substrings like 'DOT', using the string replacement method only replaces the first occurrence.
**Action:** Extract the string from the DOM element's text and parse it within the client-side event listener (e.g. `replace(/\s/g, '').replace(/DOT/g, '.').replace(/AT/g, '@')`). Ensure to use the global regex flag (`/g`) so that all occurrences of the obfuscation strings are replaced, not just the first one. Ensure to disable the button during the temporary visual feedback phase so rapid clicks don't overwrite the stored initial button state.
