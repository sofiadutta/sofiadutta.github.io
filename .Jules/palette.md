## 2024-05-23 - [Icon-Only Buttons and "Ghost" Sources]
**Learning:** Found a repository where `package.json` scripts referred to a missing `src` directory, implying the `index.html` at the root was the intended "source of truth" for this simplified version. This is a common pattern in "starter" templates where the advanced build setup is stripped out but configuration files remain.
**Action:** Always verify if build scripts actually correspond to the file structure before relying on them. When `src` is missing in a simple web project, edit the root HTML directly.

## 2024-05-23 - [Accessible Background Images and Skip Links]
**Learning:** Found critical content implemented as background images (profile photo). This pattern is invisible to screen readers unless explicitly marked with `role="img"` and `aria-label`. Also, single-page layouts like this desperately need "Skip to Content" links to allow keyboard users to bypass long navigation menus.
**Action:** When auditing legacy themes, check all `data-bg` or `background-image` inline styles for meaningful content and add ARIA attributes. Always ensure a skip link exists for sidebars.

## 2024-05-23 - [JS Crashing due to Undefined Function Call]
**Learning:** Discovered that a `ReferenceError` (calling undefined `updateYear()`) in the main JS file was silently blocking subsequent script execution, including critical features like lazy loading images. This highlights how fragile single-file script bundles can be.
**Action:** When auditing legacy JS, always check for console errors first. If a function call blocks execution, verify if it's defined. If not, and a correct alternative exists (`updateCopyrightYear`), remove the blocker.

## 2024-05-23 - [Tooltips for Icon-Only Buttons]
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons (like social links) are ambiguous for mouse users. While `aria-label` helps screen readers, sighted users benefit significantly from a native browser tooltip via the `title` attribute.
**Action:** Always add `title` attributes matching the `aria-label` for icon-only interactive elements.
## 2026-05-10 - Safely Coping Bot-Obfuscated Text
**Learning:** Obfuscated contact details (like "name DOT last AT email DOT com") are tedious for users to manually clean up. Implementing a copy-to-clipboard button that uses JavaScript (`replace(/ DOT /g, ".").replace(/ AT /g, "@").replace(/ /g, "")`) to decode the string on the fly provides a delightful, zero-friction UX while preserving the bot protection in the static HTML.
**Action:** When working with anti-scraping text obfuscation, always provide an interactive copy mechanism that seamlessly decodes the payload before writing to `navigator.clipboard`, and wrap the text target in a span for robust DOM selection.
